\subsubsection{Intel Threaded Building Blocks}
Intel Threaded Building Blocks \cite{reinders2007intel} (TBB) is a library for
scalable parallel
programming in C++. It provides templates for common parallel programming
patterns and abstracts away the details of synchronization, load-balancing,
and cache optimization. Instead of writing threads the programmer specifies
tasks, and the library maps them onto threads in an efficient manner.
