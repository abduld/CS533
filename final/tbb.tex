\subsubsection{Intel Threaded Building Blocks}
Intel Threaded Building Blocks\cite{reinders2007intel} (TBB) is a library for
scalable parallel
programming in C++. It provides templates for common parallel programming
patterns and abstracts away the details of synchronization, load-balancing,
and cache optimization. Instead of writing threads the programmer specifies
tasks, and the library maps them onto threads in an efficient manner.

We use TBB to perform parallel file I/O as well as invoking the
	\fix{cudaMalloc} call (since it does not have an asynchronus version)
	in a background thread.
Since some parts of the code need to be performed atomically, 
	setting error or modifying the list of memory objects used, for example,
	each function takes a \fix{zState\_t} object as its first argument.
The state object contains all ``global'' variables and locks needed to 
	safely modify state visable from other threads.


When the state object is created, we create a set of mutexes that
	are to be reused (a logger, error, timer, etc\ldots mutexes).
We then use a macro to allow us to easily write these mutexes:

\begin{verbatim}
#define zState_mutexed(lbl, ...)            \
  do {                                      \
    speculative_spin_mutex mutex =          \
    zState_getMutex(st, zStateLabel_##lbl); \
    mutex::scoped_lock();                   \
    { __VA_ARGS__; }                        \
  } while (0)
\end{verbatim}


Throughout our code, we use the above macro to update our state.
To set an error, for example, we just write \fix{zState\_mutexed(Error, zState\_setError(st, memoryAllocation))}.
