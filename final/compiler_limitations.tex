\subsubsection{Compiler Limitations}

Parsing errors will manifest
  themselves as runtime exceptions in the parsing code and do not
  generate human readable syntax errors.
Though the type system is required by our language sytax 
  is not enforced by the IR, it is just propagated.
It is only at the back end level that types are used to generate the
appropriate   variable definitions and/or function calls.
Finally, a lot of functionality (such as branches and most standard math 
functions) are not supported either because our test cases do not require 
them, and they would complicate the code base.
