\subsubsection{Compiler Limitations}

For this project, effort was taken to have as many features as possible.
In the case of the parser, for example, Parsing errors will manifest
  themselves as runtime exceptions in the parsing code and would not
  generate human readable syntax errors.
In the case of the type system, while required by our language sytax,
  is not enforced by the IR --- it's just propagated.
It is only at the backend level that types are used to generate the appropriate
  variable definitions and/or function calls.
Finally, a lot of functionality (such as branches and most standard math functions)
  are not supported either because our test cases do not require them, they would
  complicate the code base, or they are trivial to add.
