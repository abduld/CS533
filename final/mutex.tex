\fix{speculative\_spin\_mutex} are used to decrease overhead due to locks.
\fix{speculative\_spin\_mutex}es are a lock concept in TBB
built on top of transactional memory. The locks and unlocks in
\fix{speculative\_spin\_mutex} are marked as eligible for elision, meaning that
the lock is not modified in memory and the thread continues until it has
reached the unlock. Any changes that the thread makes to memory will not be
initially visible to other processors. If no conflicts occur during that time,
the changes are atomically committed to memory.

A conflict could either take the form of a memory location being updated, or
the lock being taken non-speculatively by another processor. To avoid false
sharing, a \fix{speculative\_spin\_mutex} takes two cache lines. This
guarantees that at least one cache line boundary will exist within the object,
so the actual lock portion of the class can fill up an entire cache line by
itself. Presently, \fix{speculative\_spin\_mutex} will only execute
speculatively on 4th-generation ``Haswell'' Intel Core parts with TSX enabled.
