\section*{Future Work}

While ZOne demonstrates some important features of an effective parallel
programming environment, there is plenty of opportunity to improve the
applicability and efficiency of the code generation.

\subsection*{OpenCL}

OpenCL is a heterogeneous computing framework for writing programs that run
on CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs, and other available computing resources. The
language is inspired by CUDA, so many of the CUDA constructs that ZOne can
generate code for can easily be retargeted to OpenCL to allow ZOne to generate
efficient code for devices that are not NVIDIA GPUs. The following sections
describe some of the notable CUDA constructs and their OpenCL counterparts.

\subsubsection*{CUDA Streams}

\subsection*{Compiler Passes}
