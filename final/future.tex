\section{Future Work}

While ZOne demonstrates some important features of an effective parallel
programming environment, there is plenty of opportunity to improve the
applicability and efficiency of the code generation.

\subsection{Runtime}

Support for OpenCL, which is a heterogeneous computing framework for writing programs that run
on CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs, and other available computing resources, would be a logical step for the runtime. The
language is inspired by CUDA, as has stream like capabilities, so many of the CUDA constructs that ZOne can
generate code for can easily be retargeted to OpenCL to allow ZOne to generate
efficient code for devices that are not NVIDIA GPUs. 

\subsection{Compiler}

It is worth mentioning that our aim was not to write an optimized
compiler (the compiler can be very slow), our aim was to have a compiler
that can generate optimized code. To that end, we have written the
compiler in Dart (a Javascript inspired language) that currently
generates sequential Javascript and threaded CUDA code from our language.
The Javascript
generation is primarily meant for debugging purposes.
