\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of GPUs into compute-heavy tasks has begun to extend to
big-data analytics. This places more emphasis on a new GPU-programming
difficulty - getting data onto the GPU in a way that does not adversely impact
performance.

We present a novel asychronous runtime that builds on prior work by providing a unified
view of disk, GPU, and GPU memory. The runtime also automatically analyzes
data and compute dependencies to optimize the schedule of I/O and compute
overlap. THis provides a simplified programming interface and can improve
performance.

We also present a new high-level language, ZOne. The ZOne compiler targets
our asynchronous runtime and demonstrates some optimizations that can be done
on high-level languages to achieve performant code. We demonstrate that 
combining ZOne and the
asynchronous runtime can improve performance over naive CUDA code by 4x in some
benchmarks.
