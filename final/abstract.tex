\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of GPUs in compute-heavy tasks has begun to extend to
big-data analytics. This places more emphasis on a new GPU-programming
difficulty - getting data onto the GPU in a way that does not adversely impact
performance.

We present a novel asychronous runtime, ZOne, that builds on prior work by
providing a unified
view of disk, GPU, and GPU memory. The runtime maintains
data and compute dependencies to optimize the schedule of I/O and compute
overlap. This provides a simplified programming interface and can further
improve performance.

We also present a new high-level language and compiler. The compiler targets
our asynchronous runtime and demonstrates some optimizations that can be done
on high-level languages to achieve performant code. We demonstrate that 
combining the language and asynchronous runtime can improve performance over
CUDA code with basic data transfer management by up to 8x on a machine with an
Intel Core i7-2820 and Nvidia Fermi Quadro 5010M.
