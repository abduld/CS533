\subsubsection{Limitations}

One of the main limitations of the runtime is that the sizes of files need to
	be known beforehand.
This is because we start allocating memory before a file is open.
A slight modification to the runtime would allow us to read file meta data 
	before starting to allocate.

Another limitation is that files are assumed to be encoded as a raw byte
	array of a specific C type.
This avoids us having to write logic to parse the file.

Both of these limitations manifest themselves because we did not want to 
	write a generic file format or file importer, since this is a problem 
	orthogonal to this project.
In the future, one can use file formats,
	such as HDF~\cite{folk2011overview}, to circumvent these implementation
	limitations.

In the case of requiring one to parse a file to extract its data into
	C datatypes, we expect that we would see more performance
	improvement, since we can perform this parsing in parallel.
