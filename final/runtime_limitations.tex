\subsubsection{Runtime Limitations}

One of the main limitations of the runtime is that the sizes of files need to
	be known beforehand.
This is because we start allocating memory before a file is open.
A slight modification to the runtime would allow us to read file meta data
	before starting to allocate without a noticeable impact in performance.

Another limitation is that files are assumed to be encoded as a raw byte
	array of a specific C type.
This avoids us having to write logic to parse the file.

Both of these limitations manifest themselves because we did not want to
	write a generic file format or file importer, since this is a problem
	orthogonal to this project.
In the future, file formats such as HDF~\cite{folk2011overview} could be used
to circumvent these implementation limitations.

The current file form limitation actually provides a performance benefit, since
presently files can be parsed in parallel.
