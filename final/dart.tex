\subsubsection{Dart}
We built our compiler using Dart\cite{dartlang}.
Dart is an open-source language developed by Google that is
designed for building scalable web apps. Dart is class-based,
single-inheritance,
object-oriented language with a syntax that is similar to C. It supports
interfaces, generics, and abstract classes. Typing is optional - it assists
with static analysis and dynamic runtime checking but it does affect the
semantics of the code.

We wrote our compiler using Dart because it both had good tooling, it allowed
	us to start writing code without concerning ourselves with \fix{Makefiles},
	and it was close to C++ (with the option to ignore types).
Because of its simplicity, our compiler and parser were just \fix{5000} lines of code.
