\subsubsection{Dart}
We built our compiler using Dart~\cite{dartlang}.
Dart is an open-source language developed by Google that is
designed for building scalable web apps. Dart is class-based,
single-inheritance,
object-oriented language with a syntax that is similar to C. It supports
interfaces, generics, and abstract classes. Typing is optional - it assists
with static analysis and dynamic runtime checking but it does affect the
semantics of the code.

Dart was selected as the language because it has good tooling, it allowed
	us to start writing code without concerning ourselves with \fix{Makefiles},
	and it is close to C++ (with the option to ignore types).
Our compiler and parser was just \fix{5000} lines of Dart code.
