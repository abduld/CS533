\subsubsection{Dart}
Dart\cite{dartlang} is an open-source language developed by Google that is
designed for building scalable web apps. Dart is class-based,
single-inheritence,
object-oriented language with a syntax that is similar to C. It supports
interfaces, generics, and abstract classes. Typing is optional - it assists
with static analysis and dynamic runtime checking but it does affect the
semantics of the code.
