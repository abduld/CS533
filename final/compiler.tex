\subsection{Compiler}

We developed a simple compiler for our language.
This allows us to 	
	analyze and generate low level code from our language.
While our compiler borrows many techniques from production compilers,
	given the time constraints it is not as robust.
Errors in the code will manifest themselves as uncaught exceptions
	in the compiler.
Regardless, we think that there are some features in the design of
	the compiler that are worth mentioning.
