\subsubsection{Compiler Passes}

Since C/CUDA code is generated, we rely on the backend compiler
	to perform further optimizations which we did not have time
	to implement.
Note that this assumption is not valid, since we also generate
	JavaScript code, but one can argue that some optimizations
	can be deligated to JavaScript optimizers such as the 
	Google Closure\todo[inline]{cite} compiler. 

\subsubsubsection{Peephole Optimization}

When lowering the AST to IR, many temporary variables are generated.
To remove them we develop a peephole optimizer and insert removal of
	temporary variables as one of our patterns.

\subsubsubsection{Closure Conversion}

Since ZOne is a functional languages, functions are 
	first class objects.
This means that some variables inside functions are not
	bound by the function scope.
A compiler pass performs closure conversions (also called
	lambda lifting) to lift the function to the global scope.
This pass uses the free variables pass and is done late,
	since other passes, such as 
	redundant code elimination, may be able to remove the
	function statement.

\subsubsubsection{Sharing Analysis}

Sharing analysis determins, based on array accesses, the 
	dependence between arrays.
