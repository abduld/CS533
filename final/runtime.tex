\subsection{Runtime}
The ZOne runtime is primarily written in C/C++. The ZOne runtime provides all
normal language runtime functions with a focus on hiding I/O latency. The ZOne
compiler provides information to the runtime about what tasks can be
interleaved. These runtime features are built on top of CUDA streams and 
Intel Threaded Building Blocks. The following sections describe the
implementation of the ZOne runtime.
