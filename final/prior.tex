\section{Prior Work}

Prior work in the IMPACT research group provided insight about memory
management and hiding implementation details.

In~\cite{gmac} the authors hide CPU
	to GPU copy latency and unifying the 
	address space (from the programmer's point of view)
	of GPU and CPU devices. 
Our work extends this by also managing file I/O and thus
	unifying disk, CPU, and GPU memory.

The industry as a whole is also moving in this direction, with CUDA 5 providing
a software view of unified memory and AMD's HSA providing true unified memory
for APUs.

Triolet\cite{rodrigues2014triolet} is a programming interface and system for
distributed-memory clusters. Triolet is able to handle
task decomposition, scheduling, and communication from the algorithmic skeleton description. Using algorithmic skeletons Triolet is able to capture parallel
computation patterns and abstract away the details of the implementation.
Triolet presents the programmer with higher-order functions through which
expressed parallelism is automatically distributed across a cluster.

While both projects were done in the IMPACT group, this work does
	not borrow any code from any other project. It did benefit from some
discussions with senior IMPACT members, who provided insight into the challenges to overcome.
In the next section we describe related work outside the IMPACT group.
