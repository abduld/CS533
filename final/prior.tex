\section{Prior Work}

As it pretains to prior work within the IMPACF group,
	the memory management is one that has some presidence.
Prior work was primarily concerned with either memory mamangemenet
	or hiding implementation details.

In~\cite{gmac} the authors hide CPU
	to GPU copy latency and unifying the 
	address space (from the programmer's point of view)
	of GPU and CPU devices.
Our work extends this by also managing file I/O and thus
	unifying disk, CPU, and GPU memory.

In Triolet\cite{rodrigues2014triolet}, a programming interface and system for
distributed-memory clusters was implemented. Triolet is able to handle
task decomposition, scheduling, and communication from the algorithmic skeleton description. Using algorithmic skeletons Triolet is able to capture parallel
computation patterns and abstract away the details of the implementation.
Triolet presents the programmer with higher-order functions through which
expressed parallelism is automatically distributed across a cluster.

While both projects were done in the IMPACT group, this work does
	not borry any code other than some discussions with senior memembers
	and understanding of some of the challenges to overcome.
In the next section we describe related work outside the IMPACT group.
