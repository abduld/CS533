\section{Prior Work}

As it pretains to prior work, the element memory management
	is one that has similar implementations in both academia
	and industry.
Prior work was primarily concerned with hiding CPU
	to GPU copy latency \cite{gmac} and/or unifying the 
	address space (from the programmer's point of view)
	of GPU and CPU devices.
Our work extends this by also managing file I/O and thus
	unifying drive, CPU, and GPU memory.
In the next section we describe similar programming models
	to ours.
