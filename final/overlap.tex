           transfer, and kernel execution. In this example, there are no
           dependencies between kernels and data so management is relateively
           simple.}

  \caption{A more complicated oververlap of host I/O, host-to-device data
           transfer, and kernel execution. Arbitrary data-dependence between
           kernels and transfers places too large a burden on the programmer
           to manage properly.}
