\section{Implementation}

ZOne generates CUDA code for NVIDIA GPUs.
It consists of a custom
runtime that uses Intel Threaded Building Blocks and CUDA Streams to enable
concurrency of host and device I/O, data transfer, and compute. The parser
uses Parser Combinators for Dart\cite{dartparsers}, and the custom compiler
analysis and transformations are written using the Dart language.
This section describes both how the combination of language choices, compiler, and runtime are used to hide
I/O latency.
