\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Overview}

ZOne currently generates CUDA code for NVIDIA GPUs. ZOne consists of a custom
runtime that uses Intel Threaded Building Blocks and CUDA Streams to enable
concurrency of host and device I/O, data transfer, and compute. The ZOne parser
uses Parser Combinators for Dart\cite{dartParsers}, and the custom compiler
analysis and transformations are written using the Dart language.
